# python-essentials-vityarthi
This repository contains my solutions, code snippets, from the Python Essentials course offered via VIT Bhopalâ€™s online learning platform (VITyarthi). It documents foundational Python concepts, hands-on exercises, and personal explorations undertaken during the course.<br><br>
I haven't added any codes from Mod 1 & Mod 2 as there were no practice sets present.
